Pomera DM100 is a distraction-free digital writing tool. Think mini laptop with only text editor application loaded.

It comes from Japan. It means its manual is in all Japanese. It becomes hard when you want to do the crucial procedure (like **upgrading firmware**) **AND** Google Translate doesn't help you much.

I can only follow some steps in [its updating guide web page](https://translate.google.co.id/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://www.kingjim.co.jp/support/pomera/software/dm100&prev=search) and the rest of important steps in [PDF](http://www.kingjim.co.jp/resource/media/support/pomera/update_dm100.pdf) are not translatable by Google Translate.

In the end, I have successfully updated my Pomera DM100 to the latest firmware.

Here are the steps:
